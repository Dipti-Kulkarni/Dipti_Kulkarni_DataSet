Clinical trials are essential for the development of new treatments, yet high participant dropout rates remain a major challenge. These dropouts can compromise statistical power, extend trial duration, and inflate costs.
This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict participant dropouts early in the clinical trial process, enabling more proactive interventions, smarter trial designs, and improved overall efficiency.
Using real-world or simulated clinical trial datasets, we:
•	Explored participant behavior and trial engagement metrics
•	Identified key predictors of early dropout
•	Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
•	Achieved strong predictive performance, with AUC scores exceeding industry benchmarks
By integrating predictive analytics into clinical trial workflows, this solution has the potential to:
•	Improve participant retention
•	Optimize resource allocation
•	Accelerate time-to-market for new therapies
This repository contains all the necessary code, notebooks, and instructions to reproduce the analysis and adapt it to other datasets or trials.
